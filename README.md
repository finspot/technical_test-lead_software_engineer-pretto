# üè° Part 1: Exercise

You need to build a simple page that reflects the following Figma project:

https://www.figma.com/file/fGhSl5GTvtFxgYR5Wuuv2n/technical_test-ui_integration?node-id=0%3A1

The page is made out of 2 main components: a **sticky** navigation bar and a **carousel**. You will choose the technical solutions you think are the most suitable. You will provide a functioning demo (if you provide a source code, please attach the proper instructions to run it). We expect that you create the most accurate result possible per the design file and the grid system you'll find within. We're looking for a UX driven interface which has accessibility and usability at its core. We would also like you to make the most performant and lightweight decisions, as if you were working on our website, where size and performances are no compromises. We wan't you to be creative, bring the best code you can write, with the same level of details you would expect from someone in your team.

**Notes**

- The carousel has to slide horizontally on mobile only. There won't be more than 3 items within.
- The mobile version of the menu may be ignored since there ain't any design provided in this test.
- You'll find some resources in the attached folder.

# üíº Part 2: Presentation

You will present the result of your exercise (that you would have sent prior to the presentation) and we'll discuss your choices, and why you think you made the right ones taking into account the lack of time and context.

Then, you will present a piece of code of your own. This work has to portray challenges you have encountered and how you tackled them. You will pick the piece you think is the most relevant in regards to the position you're applying for and that shows you're able to bring the most suitable solutions to complex problems.

In general, we want you to be as exhaustive as possible, think out loud, do not keep anything valuable for yourself.
 
# üíº Part 3: Questions

Last but not least, we'll go through a round of questions following these 2 parts, some prepared and some that would probably have popped along the way.

Enjoy! üôÇ
